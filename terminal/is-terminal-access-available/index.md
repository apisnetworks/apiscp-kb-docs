## Overview

This may also be viewed within the [control panel](https://kb.apnscp.com/control-panel/logging-into-the-control-panel/) under **Account** > **Summary** > **Dev** if _enabled_, then terminal access is also enabled for the account. If \[ssh\] => `embed_terminal` is enabled in config.ini, then a standalone terminal will also be accessible within the control panel.

## Overview

A hidden file (or folder) is one that begins with a dot ("."), e.g. `.htaccess`, `.bash_history`, `.cpan/`. These files are, by default, hidden from a FTP _LIST_ command unless configured to display. All hosting platforms show hidden files by default, so no further action is necessary.

## Overview

Passenger supports Python, Ruby, Node.js, Meteor as well as any application built using this technology. In creating several of the articles in this knowledgebase, we also created a very basic application to guide during writing. These applications are up and running under a sandbox domain and represent just a sliver of the applications that you can run using Passenger.

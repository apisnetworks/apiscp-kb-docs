## Overview

A home directory, cited very often in our knowledgebase, is the location in which all files for a particular user are stored. A home directory is located in `/home` and named after the user. For example, if your username is "_steve_", then a home directory for steve is `/home/steve`. If a user is named _example_, then the home directory for _example_ is `/home/example`, and so forth.

This location is static and may not be changed per-user without renaming the user under **User** > **Manage Users** within the [control panel](https://kb.apnscp.com/control-panel/logging-into-the-control-panel/).

### Tilde (~) notation

When referring to directories, a special notation, tilde (~) is used to refer to your home directory. For example, as the user _steve_, `~/mydir/` refers to `/home/steve/mydir`.
